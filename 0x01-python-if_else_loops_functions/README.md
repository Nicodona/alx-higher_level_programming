# With python we can use if and else statements
## the if statement is used as conditioners and changes the flow of execution of the code
## using if conditions allows you to pass a particular criteria for a give block of code to be executed
## the else statement is use to control what will happen if the if block is not satisfied
in this directory you will find codes that will use the if else statements to control the execution of codes
## the elif statement also allows you to control codes having different conditons base on different criteria  that is when you have more than two conditions
